       "\" Hello everybody, welcome to the United Stand Manchester United 3 Burnley 2. Manchester United get their first three points of the season. How are you feeling? I think that context is key here. Obviously there's going to be a deluge of people coming in saying it's embarrassing. It's not good enough this day and the other. So which I would say where have you been for the last ten years? Of course it's embarrassing. It's ridiculous how far this football club has fallen. That's why we've sacked so many managers. That's why we've wasted so much money. That's why we've got shit owners. Of course it's embarrassing. United's situation is appalling. But in the context of where we are, I'll always want my United to win. And we should have won that game. It's to need a penalty in effectively the last minute. It doesn't tell the story of the game. We should have won the game. We should have been three and a half and half time in the home and home. Burnley are not very good. They'll let them back into the game two times. Exposes the weaknesses that you're already aware of. The question is, will this board do what must be done? Whether Ruben Amricks the manager at Christmas or a new manager at Christmas, you will still quite write the EBSAT here saying why is the midfield like that? This is a midfield that costs £600,000 a week and it can't run the game against Burnley at Old Trafford. Now Bruno may very well be Man of the Match. I don't know who the Man of the Match is. Do you play ratings? Link in the video description or give us your thoughts. Sixth the average and all that jazz. But look, there's a lot to one pick there. But I'm actually very happy that going into an international break that you and I don't have to sit there in a pit of despair going, we've got one point from, you know, or two points from nine. We've got four points from nine. It's not great. We've got Man City and Chelsea to come. But we live to fight another day and I think in a battle that's all you can do. If you want my honest assessment, I'm absolutely ecstatic with one that game. The difference between winning and drawing is a weekend break, isn't it? So of course I'm happy with the result. I always want Man United to win. If you want my honest assessment, I said it against Grimsby. We're going to lose a lot of games this season. Of course we are. Maybe the Premier League is going to be more competitive than I thought it was going to be. Bournemouth have just won it at Spurs who I think are a good side. But I look at that Manchester United side and to steal a comment from Nick P and the watch along, it's incomplete. It's an incomplete team. Every game is a battle. Remember we're talking about this in the preview. You'd look at this game and you'd go a three or four, Neil win. Burnley at home, a three or four, Neil win. Can I just say we all said it. There ain't no way this is going to be comfortable today. We knew it last night. We knew it when the team came out. We knew it throughout the game. That was always never going to be two or three Neil to Manchester United. Never. It was always going to be two one or three two or you know, it was always going to be an endurance test. So I sit here not surprised and I actually sit here surprised that people would have a big reaction to that result going. It's embarrassing. It's shit. This that and the other or the other side. We're back. No. That's just who we are. If you want an honest no bullshit. Assessments of that game. That's who we are. That's what we do. We struggle against everybody. We don't put anybody away. We're capable of beating anybody but we're capable of losing to anybody. And I'm you know, I question how Burnley have scored two goals. I really do. I question why we're conceding shitty goals like that. I question why we haven't scored six. You know, we're one Neil up at half time. Zerkecy misses a sitter. I'm admissed a sitter. We should be home and host. But we've made a hell of a lot of hard work out of a game. And look, people will talk about systems and formations. The same way they did against Grimsby. Why do you need a system and a formation against Grimsby and Burnley? Why are players on one, two, three hundred grand a week not able to dominate teams like Grimsby and Burnley? This to me is the same issue I said on Thursday morning. We can sack a manager. Of course we can do. We've done it low. It's been no out to do it. We're brilliant at it. We're very good at it. So why not do it again? But I still say we've sacked so many managers and there are three contributors to any team's success and failure. There is the ownership. There is the manager and there are the players. And every single time we remove the manager and we never remove the players and we can't remove the owners. All I'm saying is it ain't going well. It ain't going to get any better. We are going to lose more games and we may well sack hammer him. In fact, I predict to be probably will but we still have the same players and we'll still have the same owners and the next manager will still be in this same boat as Amarim is a year after he comes in. That's never going to change. So if you sat here moaning about the manager, that's your right. And he may well get sacked because we're not going to suddenly start winning loads of games. But we'll still be back here in a year or two having the same chat. And you know, I don't have a solution. I'm not saying stick with Amarim and everything will get better. It won't. We need to remove a lot of players and we need to spend a lot of money on replacing them. And we probably need to change our owners because nothing's changed. What I am most interested in now here, even though it's a match reaction, is why we're not signing a midfielder. Why is David Ornstein saying apparently, man, you're not even talking to a midfielder? Why are we not buying a midfielder and why are we not realizing we're not going to finish higher than eighth this season? That midfielder will not work. Maynu, I like him. Does he really make a difference? Agate, we know he's not playing well. Kazemiro is Kazemiro. Bruno is not a midfielder. We can't dominate Burnley Old Trafford. How the bloody hell are we going to beat Palace and Newcastle and Spurs and Villa, you know, at their place? We are going to get run through in the midfielder. It's the biggest problem. Look, the goalkeeper is a problem. The goalkeeper is a problem. But so is the midfielder. We're not signing a midfielder. I don't care who the manager is. If we're seriously going to end this transfer window without a midfielder, we're done. Sack the manager. Keep the manager. It won't matter. We're done. If we don't sign a midfielder, we are done. It's that simple to me. So my biggest issue is, thank God we've won the game. We should be beating Burnley at home. We did beat Burnley at home. Well done. We should have beat them more comfortably. But we did win. Fair play. But if we don't do anything in this transfer window in the next two days, I don't know what we're moaning for. It really won't matter who's in charge. You know, we could take on a slot. We could take an enchilotti. We could take everybody. They won't be able to do anything with that midfield. And we're about to play two very good midfields, Man City and Chelsea. So I'm looking at the transfer window. I'm not looking at the result. I'm not looking at the VR. I'm not looking at the goalkeeping errors. I'm not really looking at anything other than what we do in the next two days. Because if we don't do anything in the midfield, we're done. And I'm very positive that we've won. And I hope it can kickstart it. But in the years I've watched football and you've watched football, that team does not look balanced. That team does not look complete. I don't know why Delos playing at left wing back, by the way. He's rubbish. It's incomplete. It's imbalanced. And we're three games into the season. And we don't look ready. We don't look ready, do we? We don't look ready for anything. So couldn't use injured. Mouts gone off injured. Probably are two best players before they got injured. You know, Shesh goes not settled yet. We haven't got a goalkeeper. The midfield looks horrendous. Delos playing at left wing back. I don't think things are about to get better. That's why I'll take the win and just say, let's see what happens in the last 48 hours of the window. Celebrate the win, because God knows what's coming next. That's my motto, if I'm being completely honest. With regards to the game itself, before we do the player ratings, look, if you want to get technical, I watched one of the worst officiated games and I've watched a lot at lunchtime between Chelsea and Fulham. It was horrendous. Was it a penalty on Amad? Well, you know what? I'm almost tempted not to even talk about it, because there's going to be a load of united haters saying it's a dodgy decision. There's going to be a load of united fans who want Amarim out saying it's a dodgy decision. And I'm almost going to go, I don't really care, because Amad should have scored that chance. Zerks, he should have scored that chance. We had a million other chances where we put it over the bar. Penalty or not, we should have won the game anyway. So what we're learning about a penalty pool, do I think it was a penalty? Pulling his shirt, stupid, if you give a penalty away, it's a penalty. It's a bit like Bassy last week. If you're going to wrestle someone into the ground, it's not always given, but if you do it, it could be a penalty. And also, let's not forget, Mason Mout, the referee gave a penalty. That can only be overruled if it's clear and obviously wrong. Was it clearly and obviously wrong? If it was clearly and obviously wrong, why did they need to take 20 replays to look at it? That should have been a penalty on Mount. Referee gave it on pitch. VAR said we're not so sure. They spent age just looking at it. It's meant to only get overturned if it's clearly and obviously wrong. And it wasn't clearly and obviously wrong. Was it? Because they spent so long looking at it. So penalty, yes or no, I don't bloody care. We should have won the game anyway. How you win it doesn't really matter to me. We should have won it anyway. Three, two, should have been four, nil. You know, we should have won the game. We did win the game. We should be beating Burnley at home. Bruno should be man of the match against Burnley at home. Like, I'm not going to run away with this result and say everything's okay because it's not. But I'm also not going to over dramatise it and say we were lucky because we weren't. We made hard work of the game. We should have won simply. I don't think we learn a lot either way. So why we're trying to write a story? Like, we beat Burnley. Great. My weekend's not ruined. Let's do something in the window. I don't really want to spend forever talking about Burnley because we weren't on lucky. We weren't lucky. We should have won the game. It was closer than it should have been. We should be beating Burnley. Simple as that. I don't think there's a story about Jami Amarim or Amarim out or anything like that. There's no story about systems. There's no story about Sack in a Manager. That's just dramatisation of something that doesn't exist. There's also on the flip side, no story about us being back. There's no story about us looking promising to get going this season. I think it's going to be a very difficult season if we don't make changes. Simply as that. Paul Cassidy said, did you hear Amarim played Cheryl Coles fight for this love to motivate the players? Well, if he did that, he needs to get Sacked. Have we got a quiet agreement that Brighton more sellers, Brut Belabri and January? That's how it seems we're acting. We'll have more funds now as well. Thoughts as Nikki, why January and why not now? Savage Life, thanks for your super chat. The curse is lifted. We are back. Don't worry, Mark says David. I tell you what, you know what? If you want something of positivity tonight, our record of never losing, always winning a game when we've been in front of half time, I can't believe we still got that record and it was very, very close to going today. Burnley Rob says Christopher, mate, you need to get out more. You see, you definitely need to watch football more. Burnley Rob is the most inaccurate assessment of that game ever. It can only be rage baits. They weren't robbed. Don't like what I see from Amarim at all. Feet upon the dugout is petulant and disrespectful. Bazaar behaviour in Meadage, he's big ego. We're trying to remove personalities like that. Bad leader. You clearly never spent any time around Jose Marinho or other big personalities, have you? Pep Guardiola. We should have won all three Premier League games as Nathan. Yeah, I think you make a good point, Nathan. I mean, we should have beat full him. We should have been two and a half at half time. We should have been three and a half at half time against Burnley. And we should have got a point against Arsenal. We should probably have seven points, not four. But there's still a lot of problems with that team. I don't think we can sit here and say we should have nine from nine and everything's OK. There's huge issues in that team. Cheers from LA says LA Red Devil. My son Nick and I watch the game give a shout out to him. He's feeling sick and still got up for the game. Shout out to Nick. Thank you very much. I hope you last long enough to get a goalkeeper in a midfielder, says PZ. Let's be clear. It'll be fucking criminal if we don't sign a midfielder. Criminal. And who's responsible for that? Don't thank you very much to Sean. We're going to win the league, says Luke. Have we got a quite done that one from Nikki? Mark, we did that as well. Savage life, thank you. DeLow, Delict, Yoro and Burma are best players today. I thought DeLow was shit. We're going to do the play ratings in the moment. I thought DeLow was shit. Big P. I really did. I know we got an assist, but that's like saying you score a goal. One moment over a shit performance. I don't think he played well. For the short period of time, when Manu went on, suddenly everything starts to work, because everyone was in their position. We need one more midfielder anyway, says 100. I don't think we were that good second half. I thought we were better in the first half, to be honest. I think when Mountain Kungi came off, we've got worse. I don't think Zerke C. Looks fit. I don't think Sheshko looks fit. I thought Manu was OK, but I think we were better in the first half. I backham, ran 100% since Murio. I backham ran 100% because I think whether we get sacked or not, the same problems will still be there, as I've said before. We've had a big super chat here from Bruno is a 10, kept him out of the game after half time, has to play as an 8 for his Manu from out was the demise. It's his Andrew. Yeah, hopefully that Mason Mount injury is not bad if he isn't. Players need to show low and hard. Look at Liverpool. Yeah, I've spoken about this before, Ireland boy. Liverpool have mastered the art of shooting low. Like most of their goals are low. And you know, I had shoot over the bar all the time. That's technique. If Liverpool, somebody was saying maybe it's the new ball, Liverpool is scoring goals with low shots with that ball. We're shooting over the bar all the time. Technically, these players need to do work. Come on. I think Ahmad Zerke C. Dallow and others lack the quality on the final pass as Brandon. Luke says we're going to win the league. Today's another reason why the system was never the problem. It's a matter of the players, like they want to play good football or not, says class. Mark, our coach is not using the ammo provided to him. Why is sesco sitting? He's not fit. Breach. It's very clear. We didn't deserve to win. I know everybody's happy about that. Lives in a complete denial. You need to go and watch the game back, super killer. I know you're arm-room out, but you can't make up stuff. We didn't deserve to win. Please watch the game. Look at the stats we did. Ariola reminding his class again. Today's is Gareth. They played for the coach enough for now, says Murio. These players miss some cities, but at least we got them much needed three points, is grillo. It's the players who can't finish, Mark. The player, there's nothing wrong with the system. The players aren't good enough, George. It's not about whether they missed chances. I still don't think they're good enough some of them. Midfield needs fix, but we're a hell of a lot better moving the ball with Kaz and Miros, is Oli. In my opinion, the system worked today. Players did not play well, says Asya. Kobe would need to sort himself out for the pay rise, his Michael. Winds are win. Miss so many chances. Let's just hope the club get Amarim a goalkeeper and a midfielder, says Mark. Look, I don't think this is going to happen. But if United Wenton bought Le Mens and a good midfielder now, that result becomes a lot better. You know, you come back from the international break with a good midfielder and a good goalkeeper, and the season starts going. If we don't bring a midfielder in, I think this season's going to be like that, like last year. I'm on a training Canada listening, and we once as beep, enjoy your trip, Mark, which midfielder do you have in mind before it closes? The best you can get, Sergio. I get the sentiment fielder from Panama, check him out, says Andre. Delighting with the win, disappointing performance is Rory C. We play better, such as high pressure, loads more to improve, new keeper, and a midfielder, and reminces, cola. Mayno showed the world why you can't get into the team, lacking in all areas, sending him on loan, says Marlo. For the first time, I can see what Amarim is trying to do. He just needs the players, at least in other 500 millions, his sigh. We thought it was going to be three, four versus Grims, pieces, fakes. Sometimes you just have to win, says Caleb. Hopefully a win like this is the kick we need, hope so, Caleb. Bruno doesn't play as a 10 for Portugal. No problems, is Oliver. Do you watch Portugal play Oliver? Because the second person who said this, Portugal play with a midfielder. Three, they play with two, sitters, and a more advanced midfielder. And that's Bruno. If that's not a 10, I don't know what is. We need a centre back as well as a sentiment fielder and a goalkeeper, says Maliki. Disaster averted for now, says Sanchez. I'm so happy and relieved. I hate how much this club controls me, says GGMU. This, the low with spectacular, no thinking, just crosses JB. Congratulations on winning the league, says Nicholas. Paul, thank you very much for joining the members club. Celebrating in Burnley's faces is embarrassing, says Joe Wright. Look, I don't know the pressure these players are under. I don't, you know, are we going to be the celebration, please? Bruno and the low were celebrating that corner, like they'd won the bloody league. Yeah, standards are on the floor, but I don't remember a season where, I don't remember going into a man United season saying we can't finish in the top four. So, you know, standards are on the floor. Of course, they are. Players celebrating a win. I'm not going to mone about it. It shows they care. Right, let's do the player ratings, because I know they're ready to go in the forum and I am back with you at eight o'clock tonight. We need a goalkeeper, don't we? Five. We need a goalkeeper. I think it's a little bit harsh on the second goal. It's bouncing around a lot, but does he command his area? Does he instill confidence? Of course, he doesn't below part five out of six. Average being six. Lenny, Euro and Delic today. I'd probably give them both a 6.5. It's difficult. You're playing with a goalkeeper, you can't trust. You're playing with him in field that's not good enough. And yeah, they weren't as good as previous weeks, but I don't think either of them had a bad game. And I think still they're probably our two best players this season. So 6.5 for both of them for me. Luke Shaw, probably a 6. Yeah, the left-hand side was our weakness, but more because of Delo, they were getting down that side more than the right-hand side, which is interesting when you've got Ahmad playing down the right-hand side. Bernley couldn't really exploit it, but they definitely did exploit our left-hand side. So I'd give Luke Shaw a 6. Look, Ahmad defensively, they didn't really exploit him, but going forward, I don't think he was that good up until the penalty. So I'd give him a 5.5. Yeah, I do agree. Look, he wins as the penalty at the end. He's a dangerous player. I really do like him, but he hasn't had the best start to the season. He can be a lot better. He was poor against Grimsby. He was probably slightly below average tonight. I'd give him a 5.5, but he did win the penalty. And for me, that was a penalty. So it's a big moment in the game. Kazemiro, 5.5 for me. I mean, people said his passing was good, but look, that midfield got ran through a lot. A lot. We can't control games. Games are won and lost in the midfield, and the reason we can't comfortably put teams away is bad finishing, but it's also, we always let people back in because we can't control a game. And I think this gets missed a lot in tactical analysis. When we scored the first goal, Burnley came back into the game. When we scored the second goal, Burnley came back into the game. Controlling the midfield is having that 10-15 minutes when the team is going to come at you, and you lock it down, and we never can lock it down. It's not just about teams running through our midfield. It's also about, we're very bad at locking a game down. Couldn't do it against Spullam. Couldn't do it again today. We always let teams back in because that midfield is not able to lock a game down. It's erratic. 5.3. Bruno, probably my man of the match today, give him a 7. Long Jevete probably gave it in that because the thought makes him outplayed well. But, you know, he scored the penalty. Yeah, Bruno was a 7 today. Look, I like Bruno. I like him as a 10. I don't like him in the midfield. He's erratic. He's in discipline. He's our best player and worse player at times. But I'll give him another match today. It was a big moment. He missed last week. You know, it meant a lot to him. He's not going anywhere. He's going to be a very important player for us. He's going to be a contentious issue all season if we play him as a number eight. But today, against Burnley for 300 grand a week, he should be bloody man of the match, really. I mean, what do you expect? He's one of the, he's our best player. I'd expect him against Burnley to put a performance in. And, you know, he did put a performance in today. Was it amazing? No. Was it good enough to be my amount of the match? The low was a five for me. I know he got the assist, but there was a lot of misplace passes. There was a lot of poor defensive work. There was some good crosses into the box. You can never doubt his personality, his hard work. You know, I like him as a player. I like his dedication to the cause. But he's not a left back. You know, he's woefully imbalanced and balanced. And he did get a good cut back for Embermo. He never stops running, but he is a weakness, you know? Embermo, seven, thought he had a good game. Could be a man of the match as well. Absolutely got no problem with that. I've given it to Bruno. You could give it to Embermo. Lovely goal. One of the bright sparks in the team. Really liked this signing. And I think he's growing game by game. I think he has lacked fitness because of our lady came into the squad, but he seems to be getting better by the game. That's two goals and two games. And I think this is a really important point I made in the watch along. When Bern Lee equalized last season, I think we're in big trouble. This season we score again straight away. That's why we bought Embermo and Cunya. They are Premier League game changes. And although they did equalize again, I was very impressed with how quickly we got back into the game. So if you get Embermo, man of the match, I ain't got a problem. In fact, I think you might be man of the match for you lot. Mason Mount was a 6.5. I thought he played really well, but obviously he's only played half of the game. Disappointing, I really cannot say anything other than the stories that I'm angry at about Mason Mount is that he's going to be played by injuries for a long time. He's never going to be able to play two games a week and he's probably never going to have a run of games. It's so disappointing because he's had a good start to the season. The question now, is it precautionary? Was it managed minutes? Or is he actually going to be out for six weeks? I don't know. But we can't be shocked. And to be honest, if he's out for a couple of months, I'll be fuming. But what can you do? We've got a player that he's injury prone. So I'm hoping he's not. But to be honest, with Mason Mount, you're always walking on thin ice waiting for it to crack. And I don't know what to say. Good player, but might be injured now. Same with Kanye. Look, Kanye is not injury prone, of course, but everything was going through him up until the injury. And we just hope it's not a long injury because I think he's a very, very important player for us. 6.5 for me. Masrawee, 6. Good to have him back. Maynu, probably a six. Some would say a 5.5. I don't think, you know what? I don't think Maynu did a lot wrong against Grinsby. And I don't think Maynu did a lot wrong today. Is he the player everybody's proficerizing? No. No, he's a work in progress. I think Amarim's absolutely correct. Mason, Maynu needs to stay and fight and improve. Is he ready to be in the team? No. And I think Amarim again today is proven that this whole Maynu against Amarim thing is bollocks. This is a player that is publicly saying, I want to leave, and he's coming on at half time. If Amarim didn't like Maynu, he'd have used a Garte. As riskiers, that might have been. He brings Maynu on instead of a Garte. He clearly values Maynu. And Maynu wants to go on loan. So I just think like, does Maynu come on and light the world up and make you go, we don't need a midfielder? No, we still need a midfielder. So I want Maynu to stay, but like Amarim, he's got to stay and fight and improve. He's not going to get straight into the team, guaranteed. Is he? He's not. I do want him to stay. I don't know why he wants to go. You played another 45 minutes today. Sir XC, look, he ain't fit. 5.5, he ain't fit. Looks good against Grimsby. Looked off the pace today. He's had no preseason. He looked like a player that wasn't fit. You know, he should have scored that goal. There was a few good flicks, but you know, I think you'll get better with match sharpness, certainly. Alfresco says, what game were you watching giving Bruno Man of the Match and Bermé Man of the Match? I give him the same score, mate. If you want to give him Bermé Man of the Match, fine. Benjamin Seshko. 5.5. Yeah. Good couple of chances on his head. Couldn't get them on target. Doesn't look back sharp. Needs to get sharp over the international break. This international break is actually good because players that aren't going on international duty get two weeks in their legs. Players that are going on international duty, as long as they don't get injured, come back with a couple of games under their belt. So I don't mind the September international break because the players that are behind catch up, but hopefully we'll start to see what Seshko's all about after the international break. With regards to Amarim, 50,000 watching, by the way. Thank you very much. Make sure you smash a like and subscribe. With regards to Amarim, I would say that, um, look, it's difficult because Amarim out is, again, a pelting. Amarim in is, like myself, who don't see the points in second and another manager. They're going to say, it's only Burnley, but you can only beat what's in front of you. Is it, is it Amarim's fault that we needed last minute penalty to win the game? No. It's not. Um, we should have been three nil up at half time. If that turns into four nil, he's getting a seven or an eight. Because it's a three, two last minute penalty is probably going to get five and six is from people. I would just say give it a standard six, but I don't agree with five point six because when you're looking at the game, I'm not surprised by five point six because some people just don't like Amarim now. But in the context of the game, what does the manager actually do wrong? He picks a team that should be three nil up at half time and ends up winning three two with a last minute penalty. That's a player led result. The manager has managed the three nil win for me. The players have managed the three two win. Um, but I'm not surprised. I don't think it's possible with this playing squad to win games three nil. And I think that's the lesson. That should have been three nil, but the players can't do it. They'll find a way to make it difficult every game. When was the last time you're knighted put somebody away three nil comfortably? I don't know. It might have happened recently, but we're not very good at it. So for me, I'd give Amarim a six, it's Burnley, but you could give him a high asian, you give him an any lower because it's the players that made that difficult for me. Um, Manel match. Pfft. I put my hands up. I put my hands up. I've misread the room there. I mean, no, I haven't misread the room. I'm entitled to my opinion. I think winning the game with that penalty, I'd give it to Bruno. And I do think Bruno had a good game, by the way. I do think he had a good game. So I've only given him a seven, and I gave him Bermoa seven. So if you want to give, in Bermoa, I'm out of the match. I'm very happy for him to have it, and he's got it with eight to two percent of the vote. But I do think Bruno had a good game, whether we like him or not, and I do like Bruno. I just don't like him as an eight. It's as simple as that. Ram says, Amad missed one sitter, and Bermoa had some chances, same with Erksey, when you say these players are not good enough, who are you referring to? Maybe listen to the player ratings, mate. There's a vast array of choices there. I don't need to list off who's not good enough. Like, how many players did I say aren't match fit? Well, they're not good enough then, are they? How many, you know, Amad didn't have a good game. They're not good enough then, today is he? Deload didn't have a good game. Not good enough then, today is he? Kazamiro didn't have a good game. Not good enough then, today is he? Luke Shaw was average, I'd rather have someone better. Not good enough is he? Erksey wasn't match fit, not good enough then is he? Cesco wasn't fit, not good enough then is he? Binda, not good enough. Do you want a few more? Just because I'm saying not good enough, I'm not saying let's sell them tomorrow. I'm saying there's six or seven players in that team today who are below average. You're not gonna get a good performance if you've got, I mean, look, go back through the player ratings. Who was six or above Mount? Dilitz, Yoro, Bruno and Bermoa. We only got five players above six and two of them went off injured before half time. So we're still struggling. We're incomplete. We need a midfield, we need a goalkeeper. Some of our players aren't fit. Some of them are underperforming. I ain't getting rid of Ahmad, by the way. I ain't getting rid of Cesco. I'm not getting rid of them, but they were below average today. So therefore they're not good enough. Today, they need to be better. They need to be better. Thanks everyone for watching. Get over to the fan forum. I think you better go in with Mbume, I'm not gonna match in the spamming. Mbume, MTOM. Well done. I'm back with you at eight o'clock talking transfers. It's a busy, last 24 hours, 48 hours. We need to put the pressure on about transfers. We'll be talking that eight o'clock, but get over to the fan forum. I'll see you back at eight. Make sure you smash a like and subscribe. I'll speak to you on in a bit. A wins or a win, never don't celebrate a win for man United, especially when we don't do it very often. Don't waste it. Thanks for watching. Oh, hold on before I go, fucking hell. Sorry. David's just gifted 50 memberships. Bloody hell. I'll just stay for a moment. Bloody hell. 50 memberships from David. Wow. Absolutely incredible David. I think we should go into the live chat of the fan forum with David, King David. I nearly missed it. Into the live chat, King David, go.

       "\" Hello everybody, welcome to the United Stand Manchester United 3 Burnley 2. Manchester United get their first three points of the season. How are you feeling? I think that context is key here. Obviously there's going to be a deluge of people coming in saying it's embarrassing. It's not good enough this day and the other. So which I would say where have you been for the last ten years? Of course it's embarrassing. It's ridiculous how far this football club has fallen. That's why we've sacked so many managers. That's why we've wasted so much money. That's why we've got shit owners. Of course it's embarrassing. United's situation is appalling. But in the context of where we are, I'll always want my United to win. And we should have won that game. It's to need a penalty in effectively the last minute. It doesn't tell the story of the game. We should have won the game. We should have been three and a half and half time in the home and home. Burnley are not very good. They'll let them back into the game two times. Exposes the weaknesses that you're already aware of. The question is, will this board do what must be done? Whether Ruben Amricks the manager at Christmas or a new manager at Christmas, you will still quite write the EBSAT here saying why is the midfield like that? This is a midfield that costs £600,000 a week and it can't run the game against Burnley at Old Trafford. Now Fernandes may very well be Man of the Match. I don't know who the Man of the Match is. Do you play ratings? Link in the video description or give us your thoughts. Sixth the average and all that jazz. But look, there's a lot to one pick there. But I'm actually very happy that going into an international break that you and I don't have to sit there in a pit of despair going, we've got one point from, you know, or two points from nine. We've got four points from nine. It's not great. We've got Man City and Chelsea to come. But we live to fight another day and I think in a battle that's all you can do. If you want my honest assessment, I'm absolutely ecstatic with one that game. The difference between winning and drawing is a weekend break, isn't it? So of course I'm happy with the result. I always want Man United to win. If you want my honest assessment, I said it against Grimsby. We're going to lose a lot of games this season. Of course we are. Maybe the Premier League is going to be more competitive than I thought it was going to be. Bournemouth have just won it at Spurs who I think are a good side. But I look at that Manchester United side and to steal a comment from Nick P and the watch along, it's incomplete. It's an incomplete team. Every game is a battle. Remember we're talking about this in the preview. You'd look at this game and you'd go a three or four, Neil win. Burnley at home, a three or four, Neil win. Can I just say we all said it. There ain't no way this is going to be comfortable today. We knew it last night. We knew it when the team came out. We knew it throughout the game. That was always never going to be two or three Neil to Manchester United. Never. It was always going to be two one or three two or you know, it was always going to be an endurance test. So I sit here not surprised and I actually sit here surprised that people would have a big reaction to that result going. It's embarrassing. It's shit. This that and the other or the other side. We're back. No. That's just who we are. If you want an honest no bullshit. Assessments of that game. That's who we are. That's what we do. We struggle against everybody. We don't put anybody away. We're capable of beating anybody but we're capable of losing to anybody. And I'm you know, I question how Burnley have scored two goals. I really do. I question why we're conceding shitty goals like that. I question why we haven't scored six. You know, we're one Neil up at half time. Zirkzee misses a sitter. I'm admissed a sitter. We should be home and host. But we've made a hell of a lot of hard work out of a game. And look, people will talk about systems and formations. The same way they did against Grimsby. Why do you need a system and a formation against Grimsby and Burnley? Why are players on one, two, three hundred grand a week not able to dominate teams like Grimsby and Burnley? This to me is the same issue I said on Thursday morning. We can sack a manager. Of course we can do. We've done it low. It's been no out to do it. We're brilliant at it. We're very good at it. So why not do it again? But I still say we've sacked so many managers and there are three contributors to any team's success and failure. There is the ownership. There is the manager and there are the players. And every single time we remove the manager and we never remove the players and we can't remove the owners. All I'm saying is it ain't going well. It ain't going to get any better. We are going to lose more games and we may well sack hammer him. In fact, I predict to be probably will but we still have the same players and we'll still have the same owners and the next manager will still be in this same boat as Amarim is a year after he comes in. That's never going to change. So if you sat here moaning about the manager, that's your right. And he may well get sacked because we're not going to suddenly start winning loads of games. But we'll still be back here in a year or two having the same chat. And you know, I don't have a solution. I'm not saying stick with Amarim and everything will get better. It won't. We need to remove a lot of players and we need to spend a lot of money on replacing them. And we probably need to change our owners because nothing's changed. What I am most interested in now here, even though it's a match reaction, is why we're not signing a midfielder. Why is David Ornstein saying apparently, man, you're not even talking to a midfielder? Why are we not buying a midfielder and why are we not realizing we're not going to finish higher than eighth this season? That midfielder will not work. Mainoo, I like him. Does he really make a difference? Agate, we know he's not playing well. Casemiro is Casemiro. Fernandes is not a midfielder. We can't dominate Burnley Old Trafford. How the bloody hell are we going to beat Palace and Newcastle and Spurs and Villa, you know, at their place? We are going to get run through in the midfielder. It's the biggest problem. Look, the goalkeeper is a problem. The goalkeeper is a problem. But so is the midfielder. We're not signing a midfielder. I don't care who the manager is. If we're seriously going to end this transfer window without a midfielder, we're done. Sack the manager. Keep the manager. It won't matter. We're done. If we don't sign a midfielder, we are done. It's that simple to me. So my biggest issue is, thank God we've won the game. We should be beating Burnley at home. We did beat Burnley at home. Well done. We should have beat them more comfortably. But we did win. Fair play. But if we don't do anything in this transfer window in the next two days, I don't know what we're moaning for. It really won't matter who's in charge. You know, we could take on a slot. We could take an enchilotti. We could take everybody. They won't be able to do anything with that midfield. And we're about to play two very good midfields, Man City and Chelsea. So I'm looking at the transfer window. I'm not looking at the result. I'm not looking at the VR. I'm not looking at the goalkeeping errors. I'm not really looking at anything other than what we do in the next two days. Because if we don't do anything in the midfield, we're done. And I'm very positive that we've won. And I hope it can kickstart it. But in the years I've watched football and you've watched football, that team does not look balanced. That team does not look complete. I don't know why Delos playing at left wing back, by the way. He's rubbish. It's incomplete. It's imbalanced. And we're three games into the season. And we don't look ready. We don't look ready, do we? We don't look ready for anything. So couldn't use injured. Mouts gone off injured. Probably are two best players before they got injured. You know, Shesh goes not settled yet. We haven't got a goalkeeper. The midfield looks horrendous. Delos playing at left wing back. I don't think things are about to get better. That's why I'll take the win and just say, let's see what happens in the last 48 hours of the window. Celebrate the win, because God knows what's coming next. That's my motto, if I'm being completely honest. With regards to the game itself, before we do the player ratings, look, if you want to get technical, I watched one of the worst officiated games and I've watched a lot at lunchtime between Chelsea and Fulham. It was horrendous. Was it a penalty on Diallo? Well, you know what? I'm almost tempted not to even talk about it, because there's going to be a load of united haters saying it's a dodgy decision. There's going to be a load of united fans who want Amarim out saying it's a dodgy decision. And I'm almost going to go, I don't really care, because Diallo should have scored that chance. Zerks, he should have scored that chance. We had a million other chances where we put it over the bar. Penalty or not, we should have won the game anyway. So what we're learning about a penalty pool, do I think it was a penalty? Pulling his shirt, stupid, if you give a penalty away, it's a penalty. It's a bit like Bassy last week. If you're going to wrestle someone into the ground, it's not always given, but if you do it, it could be a penalty. And also, let's not forget, Mount, the referee gave a penalty. That can only be overruled if it's clear and obviously wrong. Was it clearly and obviously wrong? If it was clearly and obviously wrong, why did they need to take 20 replays to look at it? That should have been a penalty on Mount. Referee gave it on pitch. VAR said we're not so sure. They spent age just looking at it. It's meant to only get overturned if it's clearly and obviously wrong. And it wasn't clearly and obviously wrong. Was it? Because they spent so long looking at it. So penalty, yes or no, I don't bloody care. We should have won the game anyway. How you win it doesn't really matter to me. We should have won it anyway. Three, two, should have been four, nil. You know, we should have won the game. We did win the game. We should be beating Burnley at home. Fernandes should be man of the match against Burnley at home. Like, I'm not going to run away with this result and say everything's okay because it's not. But I'm also not going to over dramatise it and say we were lucky because we weren't. We made hard work of the game. We should have won simply. I don't think we learn a lot either way. So why we're trying to write a story? Like, we beat Burnley. Great. My weekend's not ruined. Let's do something in the window. I don't really want to spend forever talking about Burnley because we weren't on lucky. We weren't lucky. We should have won the game. It was closer than it should have been. We should be beating Burnley. Simple as that. I don't think there's a story about Jami Amarim or Amarim out or anything like that. There's no story about systems. There's no story about Sack in a Manager. That's just dramatisation of something that doesn't exist. There's also on the flip side, no story about us being back. There's no story about us looking promising to get going this season. I think it's going to be a very difficult season if we don't make changes. Simply as that. Paul Cassidy said, did you hear Amarim played Cheryl Coles fight for this love to motivate the players? Well, if he did that, he needs to get Sacked. Have we got a quiet agreement that Brighton more sellers, Brut Belabri and January? That's how it seems we're acting. We'll have more funds now as well. Thoughts as Nikki, why January and why not now? Savage Life, thanks for your super chat. The curse is lifted. We are back. Don't worry, Mark says David. I tell you what, you know what? If you want something of positivity tonight, our record of never losing, always winning a game when we've been in front of half time, I can't believe we still got that record and it was very, very close to going today. Burnley Rob says Christopher, mate, you need to get out more. You see, you definitely need to watch football more. Burnley Rob is the most inaccurate assessment of that game ever. It can only be rage baits. They weren't robbed. Don't like what I see from Amarim at all. Feet upon the dugout is petulant and disrespectful. Bazaar behaviour in Meadage, he's big ego. We're trying to remove personalities like that. Bad leader. You clearly never spent any time around Jose Marinho or other big personalities, have you? Pep Guardiola. We should have won all three Premier League games as Nathan. Yeah, I think you make a good point, Nathan. I mean, we should have beat full him. We should have been two and a half at half time. We should have been three and a half at half time against Burnley. And we should have got a point against Arsenal. We should probably have seven points, not four. But there's still a lot of problems with that team. I don't think we can sit here and say we should have nine from nine and everything's OK. There's huge issues in that team. Cheers from LA says LA Red Devil. My son Nick and I watch the game give a shout out to him. He's feeling sick and still got up for the game. Shout out to Nick. Thank you very much. I hope you last long enough to get a goalkeeper in a midfielder, says PZ. Let's be clear. It'll be fucking criminal if we don't sign a midfielder. Criminal. And who's responsible for that? Don't thank you very much to Sean. We're going to win the league, says Luke. Have we got a quite done that one from Nikki? Mark, we did that as well. Savage life, thank you. Dalot, Delict, Yoro and Burma are best players today. I thought Dalot was shit. We're going to do the play ratings in the moment. I thought Dalot was shit. Big P. I really did. I know we got an assist, but that's like saying you score a goal. One moment over a shit performance. I don't think he played well. For the short period of time, when Mainoo went on, suddenly everything starts to work, because everyone was in their position. We need one more midfielder anyway, says 100. I don't think we were that good second half. I thought we were better in the first half, to be honest. I think when Mountain Kungi came off, we've got worse. I don't think Zerke C. Looks fit. I don't think Sheshko looks fit. I thought Mainoo was OK, but I think we were better in the first half. I backham, ran 100% since Murio. I backham ran 100% because I think whether we get sacked or not, the same problems will still be there, as I've said before. We've had a big super chat here from Fernandes is a 10, kept him out of the game after half time, has to play as an 8 for his Mainoo from out was the demise. It's his Andrew. Yeah, hopefully that Mason Mount injury is not bad if he isn't. Players need to show low and hard. Look at Liverpool. Yeah, I've spoken about this before, Ireland boy. Liverpool have mastered the art of shooting low. Like most of their goals are low. And you know, I had shoot over the bar all the time. That's technique. If Liverpool, somebody was saying maybe it's the new ball, Liverpool is scoring goals with low shots with that ball. We're shooting over the bar all the time. Technically, these players need to do work. Come on. I think Diallo Zerke C. Dallow and others lack the quality on the final pass as Brandon. Luke says we're going to win the league. Today's another reason why the system was never the problem. It's a matter of the players, like they want to play good football or not, says class. Mark, our coach is not using the ammo provided to him. Why is sesco sitting? He's not fit. Breach. It's very clear. We didn't deserve to win. I know everybody's happy about that. Lives in a complete denial. You need to go and watch the game back, super killer. I know you're arm-room out, but you can't make up stuff. We didn't deserve to win. Please watch the game. Look at the stats we did. Ariola reminding his class again. Today's is Gareth. They played for the coach enough for now, says Murio. These players miss some cities, but at least we got them much needed three points, is grillo. It's the players who can't finish, Mark. The player, there's nothing wrong with the system. The players aren't good enough, George. It's not about whether they missed chances. I still don't think they're good enough some of them. Midfield needs fix, but we're a hell of a lot better moving the ball with Kaz and Miros, is Oli. In my opinion, the system worked today. Players did not play well, says Asya. Kobe would need to sort himself out for the pay rise, his Michael. Winds are win. Miss so many chances. Let's just hope the club get Amarim a goalkeeper and a midfielder, says Mark. Look, I don't think this is going to happen. But if United Wenton bought Le Mens and a good midfielder now, that result becomes a lot better. You know, you come back from the international break with a good midfielder and a good goalkeeper, and the season starts going. If we don't bring a midfielder in, I think this season's going to be like that, like last year. I'm on a training Canada listening, and we once as beep, enjoy your trip, Mark, which midfielder do you have in mind before it closes? The best you can get, Sergio. I get the sentiment fielder from Panama, check him out, says Andre. Delighting with the win, disappointing performance is Rory C. We play better, such as high pressure, loads more to improve, new keeper, and a midfielder, and reminces, cola. Mayno showed the world why you can't get into the team, lacking in all areas, sending him on loan, says Marlo. For the first time, I can see what Amarim is trying to do. He just needs the players, at least in other 500 millions, his sigh. We thought it was going to be three, four versus Grims, pieces, fakes. Sometimes you just have to win, says Caleb. Hopefully a win like this is the kick we need, hope so, Caleb. Fernandes doesn't play as a 10 for Portugal. No problems, is Oliver. Do you watch Portugal play Oliver? Because the second person who said this, Portugal play with a midfielder. Three, they play with two, sitters, and a more advanced midfielder. And that's Fernandes. If that's not a 10, I don't know what is. We need a centre back as well as a sentiment fielder and a goalkeeper, says Maliki. Disaster averted for now, says Sanchez. I'm so happy and relieved. I hate how much this club controls me, says GGMU. This, the low with spectacular, no thinking, just crosses JB. Congratulations on winning the league, says Nicholas. Paul, thank you very much for joining the members club. Celebrating in Burnley's faces is embarrassing, says Joe Wright. Look, I don't know the pressure these players are under. I don't, you know, are we going to be the celebration, please? Fernandes and the low were celebrating that corner, like they'd won the bloody league. Yeah, standards are on the floor, but I don't remember a season where, I don't remember going into a man United season saying we can't finish in the top four. So, you know, standards are on the floor. Of course, they are. Players celebrating a win. I'm not going to mone about it. It shows they care. Right, let's do the player ratings, because I know they're ready to go in the forum and I am back with you at eight o'clock tonight. We need a goalkeeper, don't we? Five. We need a goalkeeper. I think it's a little bit harsh on the second goal. It's bouncing around a lot, but does he command his area? Does he instill confidence? Of course, he doesn't below part five out of six. Average being six. Lenny, Yoro and De Ligt today. I'd probably give them both a 6.5. It's difficult. You're playing with a goalkeeper, you can't trust. You're playing with him in field that's not good enough. And yeah, they weren't as good as previous weeks, but I don't think either of them had a bad game. And I think still they're probably our two best players this season. So 6.5 for both of them for me. Shaw, probably a 6. Yeah, the left-hand side was our weakness, but more because of Dalot, they were getting down that side more than the right-hand side, which is interesting when you've got Diallo playing down the right-hand side. Bernley couldn't really exploit it, but they definitely did exploit our left-hand side. So I'd give Shaw a 6. Look, Diallo defensively, they didn't really exploit him, but going forward, I don't think he was that good up until the penalty. So I'd give him a 5.5. Yeah, I do agree. Look, he wins as the penalty at the end. He's a dangerous player. I really do like him, but he hasn't had the best start to the season. He can be a lot better. He was poor against Grimsby. He was probably slightly below average tonight. I'd give him a 5.5, but he did win the penalty. And for me, that was a penalty. So it's a big moment in the game. Casemiro, 5.5 for me. I mean, people said his passing was good, but look, that midfield got ran through a lot. A lot. We can't control games. Games are won and lost in the midfield, and the reason we can't comfortably put teams away is bad finishing, but it's also, we always let people back in because we can't control a game. And I think this gets missed a lot in tactical analysis. When we scored the first goal, Burnley came back into the game. When we scored the second goal, Burnley came back into the game. Controlling the midfield is having that 10-15 minutes when the team is going to come at you, and you lock it down, and we never can lock it down. It's not just about teams running through our midfield. It's also about, we're very bad at locking a game down. Couldn't do it against Spullam. Couldn't do it again today. We always let teams back in because that midfield is not able to lock a game down. It's erratic. 5.3. Fernandes, probably my man of the match today, give him a 7. Long Jevete probably gave it in that because the thought makes him outplayed well. But, you know, he scored the penalty. Yeah, Fernandes was a 7 today. Look, I like Fernandes. I like him as a 10. I don't like him in the midfield. He's erratic. He's in discipline. He's our best player and worse player at times. But I'll give him another match today. It was a big moment. He missed last week. You know, it meant a lot to him. He's not going anywhere. He's going to be a very important player for us. He's going to be a contentious issue all season if we play him as a number eight. But today, against Burnley for 300 grand a week, he should be bloody man of the match, really. I mean, what do you expect? He's one of the, he's our best player. I'd expect him against Burnley to put a performance in. And, you know, he did put a performance in today. Was it amazing? No. Was it good enough to be my amount of the match? The low was a five for me. I know he got the assist, but there was a lot of misplace passes. There was a lot of poor defensive work. There was some good crosses into the box. You can never doubt his personality, his hard work. You know, I like him as a player. I like his dedication to the cause. But he's not a left back. You know, he's woefully imbalanced and balanced. And he did get a good cut back for Mbeumo. He never stops running, but he is a weakness, you know? Mbeumo, seven, thought he had a good game. Could be a man of the match as well. Absolutely got no problem with that. I've given it to Fernandes. You could give it to Mbeumo. Lovely goal. One of the bright sparks in the team. Really liked this signing. And I think he's growing game by game. I think he has lacked fitness because of our lady came into the squad, but he seems to be getting better by the game. That's two goals and two games. And I think this is a really important point I made in the watch along. When Bern Lee equalized last season, I think we're in big trouble. This season we score again straight away. That's why we bought Mbeumo and Cunha. They are Premier League game changes. And although they did equalize again, I was very impressed with how quickly we got back into the game. So if you get Mbeumo, man of the match, I ain't got a problem. In fact, I think you might be man of the match for you lot. Mason Mount was a 6.5. I thought he played really well, but obviously he's only played half of the game. Disappointing, I really cannot say anything other than the stories that I'm angry at about Mason Mount is that he's going to be played by injuries for a long time. He's never going to be able to play two games a week and he's probably never going to have a run of games. It's so disappointing because he's had a good start to the season. The question now, is it precautionary? Was it managed minutes? Or is he actually going to be out for six weeks? I don't know. But we can't be shocked. And to be honest, if he's out for a couple of months, I'll be fuming. But what can you do? We've got a player that he's injury prone. So I'm hoping he's not. But to be honest, with Mason Mount, you're always walking on thin ice waiting for it to crack. And I don't know what to say. Good player, but might be injured now. Same with Kanye. Look, Kanye is not injury prone, of course, but everything was going through him up until the injury. And we just hope it's not a long injury because I think he's a very, very important player for us. 6.5 for me. Mazraoui, 6. Good to have him back. Mainoo, probably a six. Some would say a 5.5. I don't think, you know what? I don't think Mainoo did a lot wrong against Grinsby. And I don't think Mainoo did a lot wrong today. Is he the player everybody's proficerizing? No. No, he's a work in progress. I think Amarim's absolutely correct. Mason, Mainoo needs to stay and fight and improve. Is he ready to be in the team? No. And I think Amarim again today is proven that this whole Mainoo against Amarim thing is bollocks. This is a player that is publicly saying, I want to leave, and he's coming on at half time. If Amarim didn't like Mainoo, he'd have used a Garte. As riskiers, that might have been. He brings Mainoo on instead of a Garte. He clearly values Mainoo. And Mainoo wants to go on loan. So I just think like, does Mainoo come on and light the world up and make you go, we don't need a midfielder? No, we still need a midfielder. So I want Mainoo to stay, but like Amarim, he's got to stay and fight and improve. He's not going to get straight into the team, guaranteed. Is he? He's not. I do want him to stay. I don't know why he wants to go. You played another 45 minutes today. Zirkzee, look, he ain't fit. 5.5, he ain't fit. Looks good against Grimsby. Looked off the pace today. He's had no preseason. He looked like a player that wasn't fit. You know, he should have scored that goal. There was a few good flicks, but you know, I think you'll get better with match sharpness, certainly. Alfresco says, what game were you watching giving Fernandes Man of the Match and Bermé Man of the Match? I give him the same score, mate. If you want to give him Bermé Man of the Match, fine. Benjamin Sesko. 5.5. Yeah. Good couple of chances on his head. Couldn't get them on target. Doesn't look back sharp. Needs to get sharp over the international break. This international break is actually good because players that aren't going on international duty get two weeks in their legs. Players that are going on international duty, as long as they don't get injured, come back with a couple of games under their belt. So I don't mind the September international break because the players that are behind catch up, but hopefully we'll start to see what Sesko's all about after the international break. With regards to Amarim, 50,000 watching, by the way. Thank you very much. Make sure you smash a like and subscribe. With regards to Amarim, I would say that, um, look, it's difficult because Amarim out is, again, a pelting. Amarim in is, like myself, who don't see the points in second and another manager. They're going to say, it's only Burnley, but you can only beat what's in front of you. Is it, is it Amarim's fault that we needed last minute penalty to win the game? No. It's not. Um, we should have been three nil up at half time. If that turns into four nil, he's getting a seven or an eight. Because it's a three, two last minute penalty is probably going to get five and six is from people. I would just say give it a standard six, but I don't agree with five point six because when you're looking at the game, I'm not surprised by five point six because some people just don't like Amarim now. But in the context of the game, what does the manager actually do wrong? He picks a team that should be three nil up at half time and ends up winning three two with a last minute penalty. That's a player led result. The manager has managed the three nil win for me. The players have managed the three two win. Um, but I'm not surprised. I don't think it's possible with this playing squad to win games three nil. And I think that's the lesson. That should have been three nil, but the players can't do it. They'll find a way to make it difficult every game. When was the last time you're knighted put somebody away three nil comfortably? I don't know. It might have happened recently, but we're not very good at it. So for me, I'd give Amarim a six, it's Burnley, but you could give him a high asian, you give him an any lower because it's the players that made that difficult for me. Um, Manel match. Pfft. I put my hands up. I put my hands up. I've misread the room there. I mean, no, I haven't misread the room. I'm entitled to my opinion. I think winning the game with that penalty, I'd give it to Fernandes. And I do think Fernandes had a good game, by the way. I do think he had a good game. So I've only given him a seven, and I gave him Bermoa seven. So if you want to give, in Bermoa, I'm out of the match. I'm very happy for him to have it, and he's got it with eight to two percent of the vote. But I do think Fernandes had a good game, whether we like him or not, and I do like Fernandes. I just don't like him as an eight. It's as simple as that. Ram says, Diallo missed one sitter, and Bermoa had some chances, same with Erksey, when you say these players are not good enough, who are you referring to? Maybe listen to the player ratings, mate. There's a vast array of choices there. I don't need to list off who's not good enough. Like, how many players did I say aren't match fit? Well, they're not good enough then, are they? How many, you know, Diallo didn't have a good game. They're not good enough then, today is he? Deload didn't have a good game. Not good enough then, today is he? Kazamiro didn't have a good game. Not good enough then, today is he? Shaw was average, I'd rather have someone better. Not good enough is he? Erksey wasn't match fit, not good enough then is he? Cesco wasn't fit, not good enough then is he? Binda, not good enough. Do you want a few more? Just because I'm saying not good enough, I'm not saying let's sell them tomorrow. I'm saying there's six or seven players in that team today who are below average. You're not gonna get a good performance if you've got, I mean, look, go back through the player ratings. Who was six or above Mount? Dilitz, Yoro, Fernandes and Bermoa. We only got five players above six and two of them went off injured before half time. So we're still struggling. We're incomplete. We need a midfield, we need a goalkeeper. Some of our players aren't fit. Some of them are underperforming. I ain't getting rid of Diallo, by the way. I ain't getting rid of Cesco. I'm not getting rid of them, but they were below average today. So therefore they're not good enough. Today, they need to be better. They need to be better. Thanks everyone for watching. Get over to the fan forum. I think you better go in with Mbume, I'm not gonna match in the spamming. Mbume, MTOM. Well done. I'm back with you at eight o'clock talking transfers. It's a busy, last 24 hours, 48 hours. We need to put the pressure on about transfers. We'll be talking that eight o'clock, but get over to the fan forum. I'll see you back at eight. Make sure you smash a like and subscribe. I'll speak to you on in a bit. A wins or a win, never don't celebrate a win for man United, especially when we don't do it very often. Don't waste it. Thanks for watching. Oh, hold on before I go, fucking hell. Sorry. David's just gifted 50 memberships. Bloody hell. I'll just stay for a moment. Bloody hell. 50 memberships from David. Wow. Absolutely incredible David. I think we should go into the live chat of the fan forum with David, King David. I nearly missed it. Into the live chat, King David, go. Speak to you in a bit. letter flying over to Beyonce. Ah.\""

      " Hello everybody, welcome to the United Stand Manchester United 3 Burnley 2.\n",
      "Manchester United get their first three points of the season.\n",
      "How are you feeling?\n",
      "I think that context is key here.\n",
      "Obviously there's going to be a deluge of people coming in saying it's embarrassing.\n",
      "It's not good enough this day and the other.\n",
      "So which I would say where have you been for the last ten years?\n",
      "Of course it's embarrassing.\n",
      "It's ridiculous how far this football club has fallen.\n",
      "That's why we've sacked so many managers.\n",
      "That's why we've wasted so much money.\n",
      "That's why we've got shit owners.\n",
      "Of course it's embarrassing.\n",
      "United's situation is appalling.\n",
      "But in the context of where we are, I'll always want my United to win.\n",
      "And we should have won that game.\n",
      "It's to need a penalty in effectively the last minute.\n",
      "It doesn't tell the story of the game.\n",
      "We should have won the game.\n",
      "We should have been three and a half and half time in the home and home.\n",
      "Burnley are not very good.\n",
      "They'll let them back into the game two times.\n",
      "Exposes the weaknesses that you're already aware of.\n",
      "The question is, will this board do what must be done?\n",
      "Whether Ruben Amricks the manager at Christmas or a new manager at Christmas, you will still quite write the EBSAT here saying why is the midfield like that?\n",
      "This is a midfield that costs £600,000 a week and it can't run the game against Burnley at Old Trafford.\n",
      "Now Fernandes may very well be Man of the Match.\n",
      "I don't know who the Man of the Match is.\n",
      "Do you play ratings?\n",
      "Link in the video description or give us your thoughts.\n",
      "Sixth the average and all that jazz.\n",
      "But look, there's a lot to one pick there.\n",
      "But I'm actually very happy that going into an international break that you and I don't have to sit there in a pit of despair going, we've got one point from, you know, or two points from nine.\n",
      "We've got four points from nine.\n",
      "It's not great.\n",
      "We've got Man City and Chelsea to come.\n",
      "But we live to fight another day and I think in a battle that's all you can do.\n",
      "If you want my honest assessment, I'm absolutely ecstatic with one that game.\n",
      "The difference between winning and drawing is a weekend break, isn't it?\n",
      "So of course I'm happy with the result.\n",
      "I always want Man United to win.\n",
      "If you want my honest assessment, I said it against Grimsby.\n",
      "We're going to lose a lot of games this season.\n",
      "Of course we are.\n",
      "Maybe the Premier League is going to be more competitive than I thought it was going to be.\n",
      "Bournemouth have just won it at Spurs who I think are a good side.\n",
      "But I look at that Manchester United side and to steal a comment from Nick P and the watch along, it's incomplete.\n",
      "It's an incomplete team.\n",
      "Every game is a battle.\n",
      "Remember we're talking about this in the preview.\n",
      "You'd look at this game and you'd go a three or four, Neil win.\n",
      "Burnley at home, a three or four, Neil win.\n",
      "Can I just say we all said it.\n",
      "There ain't no way this is going to be comfortable today.\n",
      "We knew it last night.\n",
      "We knew it when the team came out.\n",
      "We knew it throughout the game.\n",
      "That was always never going to be two or three Neil to Manchester United.\n",
      "Never.\n",
      "It was always going to be two one or three two or you know, it was always going to be an endurance test.\n",
      "So I sit here not surprised\n",
      "and I actually sit here surprised that people would have a big reaction to that result going.\n",
      "It's embarrassing.\n",
      "It's shit.\n",
      "This that and the other or the other side.\n",
      "We're back.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "That's just who we are.\n",
      "If you want an honest no bullshit.\n",
      "Assessments of that game.\n",
      "That's who we are.\n",
      "That's what we do.\n",
      "We struggle against everybody.\n",
      "We don't put anybody away.\n",
      "We're capable of beating anybody but we're capable of losing to anybody.\n",
      "And I'm you know, I question how Burnley have scored two goals.\n",
      "I really do.\n",
      "I question why we're conceding shitty goals like that.\n",
      "I question why we haven't scored six.\n",
      "You know, we're one Neil up at half time.\n",
      "Zirkzee misses a sitter.\n",
      "I'm admissed a sitter.\n",
      "We should be home and host.\n",
      "But we've made a hell of a lot of hard work out of a game.\n",
      "And look, people will talk about systems and formations.\n",
      "The same way they did against Grimsby.\n",
      "Why do you need a system and a formation against Grimsby and Burnley?\n",
      "Why are players on one, two, three hundred grand a week not able to dominate teams like Grimsby and Burnley?\n",
      "This to me is the same issue I said on Thursday morning.\n",
      "We can sack a manager.\n",
      "Of course we can do.\n",
      "We've done it low.\n",
      "It's been no out to do it.\n",
      "We're brilliant at it.\n",
      "We're very good at it.\n",
      "So why not do it again?\n",
      "But I still say we've sacked so many managers and there are three contributors to any team's success and failure.\n",
      "There is the ownership.\n",
      "There is the manager and there are the players.\n",
      "And every single time we remove the manager and we never remove the players and we can't remove the owners.\n",
      "All I'm saying is it ain't going well.\n",
      "It ain't going to get any better.\n",
      "We are going to lose more games and we may well sack hammer him.\n",
      "In fact, I predict to be probably will\n",
      "but we still have the same players and we'll still have the same owners and the next manager will still be in this same boat as Amarim is a year after he comes in.\n",
      "That's never going to change.\n",
      "So if you sat here moaning about the manager, that's your right.\n",
      "And he may well get sacked because we're not going to suddenly start winning loads of games.\n",
      "But we'll still be back here in a year or two having the same chat.\n",
      "And you know, I don't have a solution.\n",
      "I'm not saying stick with Amarim and everything will get better.\n",
      "It won't.\n",
      "We need to remove a lot of players and we need to spend a lot of money on replacing them.\n",
      "And we probably need to change our owners because nothing's changed.\n",
      "What I am most interested in now here, even though it's a match reaction, is why we're not signing a midfielder.\n",
      "Why is David Ornstein saying apparently, man, you're not even talking to a midfielder?\n",
      "Why are we not buying a midfielder and why are we not realizing we're not going to finish higher than eighth this season?\n",
      "That midfielder will not work.\n",
      "Mainoo, I like him.\n",
      "Does he really make a difference?\n",
      "Agate, we know he's not playing well.\n",
      "Casemiro is Casemiro.\n",
      "Fernandes is not a midfielder.\n",
      "We can't dominate Burnley Old Trafford.\n",
      "How the bloody hell are we going to beat Palace and Newcastle and Spurs and Villa, you know, at their place?\n",
      "We are going to get run through in the midfielder.\n",
      "It's the biggest problem.\n",
      "Look, the goalkeeper is a problem.\n",
      "The goalkeeper is a problem.\n",
      "But so is the midfielder.\n",
      "We're not signing a midfielder.\n",
      "I don't care who the manager is.\n",
      "If we're seriously going to end this transfer window without a midfielder, we're done.\n",
      "Sack the manager.\n",
      "Keep the manager.\n",
      "It won't matter.\n",
      "We're done.\n",
      "If we don't sign a midfielder, we are done.\n",
      "It's that simple to me.\n",
      "So my biggest issue is, thank God we've won the game.\n",
      "We should be beating Burnley at home.\n",
      "We did beat Burnley at home.\n",
      "Well done.\n",
      "We should have beat them more comfortably.\n",
      "But we did win.\n",
      "Fair play.\n",
      "But if we don't do anything in this transfer window in the next two days, I don't know what we're moaning for.\n",
      "It really won't matter who's in charge.\n",
      "You know, we could take on a slot.\n",
      "We could take an enchilotti.\n",
      "We could take everybody.\n",
      "They won't be able to do anything with that midfield.\n",
      "And we're about to play two very good midfields, Man City and Chelsea.\n",
      "So I'm looking at the transfer window.\n",
      "I'm not looking at the result.\n",
      "I'm not looking at the VR.\n",
      "I'm not looking at the goalkeeping errors.\n",
      "I'm not really looking at anything other than what we do in the next two days.\n",
      "Because if we don't do anything in the midfield, we're done.\n",
      "And I'm very positive that we've won.\n",
      "And I hope it can kickstart it.\n",
      "But in the years I've watched football and you've watched football, that team does not look balanced.\n",
      "That team does not look complete.\n",
      "I don't know why Delos playing at left wing back, by the way.\n",
      "He's rubbish.\n",
      "It's incomplete.\n",
      "It's imbalanced.\n",
      "And we're three games into the season.\n",
      "And we don't look ready.\n",
      "We don't look ready, do we?\n",
      "We don't look ready for anything.\n",
      "So couldn't use injured.\n",
      "Mouts gone off injured.\n",
      "Probably are two best players before they got injured.\n",
      "You know, Shesh goes not settled yet.\n",
      "We haven't got a goalkeeper.\n",
      "The midfield looks horrendous.\n",
      "Delos playing at left wing back.\n",
      "I don't think things are about to get better.\n",
      "That's why I'll take the win and just say, let's see what happens in the last 48 hours of the window.\n",
      "Celebrate the win, because God knows what's coming next.\n",
      "That's my motto, if I'm being completely honest.\n",
      "With regards to the game itself, before we do the player ratings, look, if you want to get technical, I watched one of the worst officiated games and I've watched a lot at lunchtime between Chelsea and Fulham.\n",
      "It was horrendous.\n",
      "Was it a penalty on Diallo?\n",
      "Well, you know what?\n",
      "I'm almost tempted not to even talk about it, because there's going to be a load of united haters saying it's a dodgy decision.\n",
      "There's going to be a load of united fans who want Amarim out saying it's a dodgy decision.\n",
      "And I'm almost going to go, I don't really care, because Diallo should have scored that chance.\n",
      "Zerks, he should have scored that chance.\n",
      "We had a million other chances where we put it over the bar.\n",
      "Penalty or not, we should have won the game anyway.\n",
      "So what we're learning about a penalty pool, do I think it was a penalty?\n",
      "Pulling his shirt, stupid, if you give a penalty away, it's a penalty.\n",
      "It's a bit like Bassy last week.\n",
      "If you're going to wrestle someone into the ground, it's not always given, but if you do it, it could be a penalty.\n",
      "And also, let's not forget, Mount, the referee gave a penalty.\n",
      "That can only be overruled if it's clear and obviously wrong.\n",
      "Was it clearly and obviously wrong?\n",
      "If it was clearly and obviously wrong, why did they need to take 20 replays to look at it?\n",
      "That should have been a penalty on Mount.\n",
      "Referee gave it on pitch.\n",
      "VAR said we're not so sure.\n",
      "They spent age just looking at it.\n",
      "It's meant to only get overturned if it's clearly and obviously wrong.\n",
      "And it wasn't clearly and obviously wrong.\n",
      "Was it?\n",
      "Because they spent so long looking at it.\n",
      "So penalty, yes or no, I don't bloody care.\n",
      "We should have won the game anyway.\n",
      "How you win it doesn't really matter to me.\n",
      "We should have won it anyway.\n",
      "Three, two, should have been four, nil.\n",
      "You know, we should have won the game.\n",
      "We did win the game.\n",
      "We should be beating Burnley at home.\n",
      "Fernandes should be man of the match against Burnley at home.\n",
      "Like, I'm not going to run away with this result and say everything's okay because it's not.\n",
      "But I'm also not going to over dramatise it and say we were lucky because we weren't.\n",
      "We made hard work of the game.\n",
      "We should have won simply.\n",
      "I don't think we learn a lot either way.\n",
      "So why we're trying to write a story?\n",
      "Like, we beat Burnley.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "My weekend's not ruined.\n",
      "Let's do something in the window.\n",
      "I don't really want to spend forever talking about Burnley because we weren't on lucky.\n",
      "We weren't lucky.\n",
      "We should have won the game.\n",
      "It was closer than it should have been.\n",
      "We should be beating Burnley.\n",
      "Simple as that.\n",
      "I don't think there's a story about Jami Amarim or Amarim out or anything like that.\n",
      "There's no story about systems.\n",
      "There's no story about Sack in a Manager.\n",
      "That's just dramatisation of something that doesn't exist.\n",
      "There's also on the flip side, no story about us being back.\n",
      "There's no story about us looking promising to get going this season.\n",
      "I think it's going to be a very difficult season if we don't make changes.\n",
      "Simply as that.\n",
      "Paul Cassidy said, did you hear Amarim played Cheryl Coles fight for this love to motivate the players?\n",
      "Well, if he did that, he needs to get Sacked.\n",
      "Have we got a quiet agreement that Brighton more sellers, Brut Belabri and January?\n",
      "That's how it seems we're acting.\n",
      "We'll have more funds now as well.\n",
      "Thoughts as Nikki, why January and why not now?\n",
      "Savage Life, thanks for your super chat.\n",
      "The curse is lifted.\n",
      "We are back.\n",
      "Don't worry, Mark says David.\n",
      "I tell you what, you know what?\n",
      "If you want something of positivity tonight, our record of never losing, always winning a game when we've been in front of half time, I can't believe we still got that record and it was very, very close to going today.\n",
      "Burnley Rob says Christopher, mate, you need to get out more.\n",
      "You see, you definitely need to watch football more.\n",
      "Burnley Rob is the most inaccurate assessment of that game ever.\n",
      "It can only be rage baits.\n",
      "They weren't robbed.\n",
      "Don't like what I see from Amarim at all.\n",
      "Feet upon the dugout is petulant and disrespectful.\n",
      "Bazaar behaviour in Meadage, he's big ego.\n",
      "We're trying to remove personalities like that.\n",
      "Bad leader.\n",
      "You clearly never spent any time around Jose Marinho or other big personalities, have you?\n",
      "Pep Guardiola.\n",
      "We should have won all three Premier League games as Nathan.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think you make a good point, Nathan.\n",
      "I mean, we should have beat full him.\n",
      "We should have been two and a half at half time.\n",
      "We should have been three and a half at half time against Burnley.\n",
      "And we should have got a point against Arsenal.\n",
      "We should probably have seven points, not four.\n",
      "But there's still a lot of problems with that team.\n",
      "I don't think we can sit here and say we should have nine from nine and everything's OK.\n",
      "There's huge issues in that team.\n",
      "Cheers from LA says LA Red Devil.\n",
      "My son Nick\n",
      "and I watch the game give a shout out to him.\n",
      "He's feeling sick and still got up for the game.\n",
      "Shout out to Nick.\n",
      "Thank you very much.\n",
      "I hope you last long enough to get a goalkeeper in a midfielder, says PZ.\n",
      "Let's be clear.\n",
      "It'll be fucking criminal if we don't sign a midfielder.\n",
      "Criminal.\n",
      "And who's responsible for that?\n",
      "Don't thank you very much to Sean.\n",
      "We're going to win the league, says Luke.\n",
      "Have we got a quite done that one from Nikki?\n",
      "Mark, we did that as well.\n",
      "Savage life, thank you.\n",
      "Dalot, Delict, Yoro and Burma are best players today.\n",
      "I thought Dalot was shit.\n",
      "We're going to do the play ratings in the moment.\n",
      "I thought Dalot was shit.\n",
      "Big P. I really did.\n",
      "I know we got an assist, but that's like saying you score a goal.\n",
      "One moment over a shit performance.\n",
      "I don't think he played well.\n",
      "For the short period of time, when Mainoo went on, suddenly everything starts to work, because everyone was in their position.\n",
      "We need one more midfielder anyway, says 100.\n",
      "I don't think we were that good second half.\n",
      "I thought we were better in the first half, to be honest.\n",
      "I think when Mountain Kungi came off, we've got worse.\n",
      "I don't think Zerke C. Looks fit.\n",
      "I don't think Sheshko looks fit.\n",
      "I thought Mainoo was OK, but I think we were better in the first half.\n",
      "I backham, ran 100% since Murio.\n",
      "I backham ran 100% because I think whether we get sacked or not, the same problems will still be there, as I've said before.\n",
      "We've had a big super chat here from Fernandes is a 10, kept him out of the game after half time, has to play as an 8 for his Mainoo from out was the demise.\n",
      "It's his Andrew.\n",
      "Yeah, hopefully that Mason Mount injury is not bad if he isn't.\n",
      "Players need to show low and hard.\n",
      "Look at Liverpool.\n",
      "Yeah, I've spoken about this before, Ireland boy.\n",
      "Liverpool have mastered the art of shooting low.\n",
      "Like most of their goals are low.\n",
      "And you know, I had shoot over the bar all the time.\n",
      "That's technique.\n",
      "If Liverpool, somebody was saying maybe it's the new ball, Liverpool is scoring goals with low shots with that ball.\n",
      "We're shooting over the bar all the time.\n",
      "Technically, these players need to do work.\n",
      "Come on.\n",
      "I think Diallo Zerke C. Dallow and others lack the quality on the final pass as Brandon.\n",
      "Luke says we're going to win the league.\n",
      "Today's another reason why the system was never the problem.\n",
      "It's a matter of the players, like they want to play good football or not, says class.\n",
      "Mark, our coach is not using the ammo provided to him.\n",
      "Why is sesco sitting?\n",
      "He's not fit.\n",
      "Breach.\n",
      "It's very clear.\n",
      "We didn't deserve to win.\n",
      "I know everybody's happy about that.\n",
      "Lives in a complete denial.\n",
      "You need to go and watch the game back, super killer.\n",
      "I know you're arm-room out, but you can't make up stuff.\n",
      "We didn't deserve to win.\n",
      "Please watch the game.\n",
      "Look at the stats we did.\n",
      "Ariola reminding his class again.\n",
      "Today's is Gareth.\n",
      "They played for the coach enough for now, says Murio.\n",
      "These players miss some cities, but at least we got them much needed three points, is grillo.\n",
      "It's the players who can't finish, Mark.\n",
      "The player, there's nothing wrong with the system.\n",
      "The players aren't good enough, George.\n",
      "It's not about whether they missed chances.\n",
      "I still don't think they're good enough some of them.\n",
      "Midfield needs fix, but we're a hell of a lot better moving the ball with Kaz and Miros, is Oli.\n",
      "In my opinion, the system worked today.\n",
      "Players did not play well, says Asya.\n",
      "Kobe would need to sort himself out for the pay rise, his Michael.\n",
      "Winds are win.\n",
      "Miss so many chances.\n",
      "Let's just hope the club get Amarim a goalkeeper and a midfielder, says Mark.\n",
      "Look, I don't think this is going to happen.\n",
      "But if United Wenton bought Le Mens and a good midfielder now, that result becomes a lot better.\n",
      "You know, you come back from the international break with a good midfielder and a good goalkeeper, and the season starts going.\n",
      "If we don't bring a midfielder in, I think this season's going to be like that, like last year.\n",
      "I'm on a training Canada listening, and we once as beep, enjoy your trip, Mark, which midfielder do you have in mind before it closes?\n",
      "The best you can get, Sergio.\n",
      "I get the sentiment fielder from Panama, check him out, says Andre.\n",
      "Delighting with the win, disappointing performance is Rory C. We play better, such as high pressure, loads more to improve, new keeper, and a midfielder, and reminces, cola.\n",
      "Mayno showed the world why you can't get into the team, lacking in all areas, sending him on loan, says Marlo.\n",
      "For the first time, I can see what Amarim is trying to do.\n",
      "He just needs the players, at least in other 500 millions, his sigh.\n",
      "We thought it was going to be three, four versus Grims, pieces, fakes.\n",
      "Sometimes you just have to win, says Caleb.\n",
      "Hopefully a win like this is the kick we need, hope so, Caleb.\n",
      "Fernandes doesn't play as a 10 for Portugal.\n",
      "No problems, is Oliver.\n",
      "Do you watch Portugal play Oliver?\n",
      "Because the second person who said this, Portugal play with a midfielder.\n",
      "Three, they play with two, sitters, and a more advanced midfielder.\n",
      "And that's Fernandes.\n",
      "If that's not a 10, I don't know what is.\n",
      "We need a centre back as well as a sentiment fielder and a goalkeeper, says Maliki.\n",
      "Disaster averted for now, says Sanchez.\n",
      "I'm so happy and relieved.\n",
      "I hate how much this club controls me, says GGMU.\n",
      "This, the low with spectacular, no thinking, just crosses JB.\n",
      "Congratulations on winning the league, says Nicholas.\n",
      "Paul, thank you very much for joining the members club.\n",
      "Celebrating in Burnley's faces is embarrassing, says Joe Wright.\n",
      "Look, I don't know the pressure these players are under.\n",
      "I don't, you know, are we going to be the celebration, please?\n",
      "Fernandes and the low were celebrating that corner, like they'd won the bloody league.\n",
      "Yeah, standards are on the floor, but I don't remember a season where, I don't remember going into a man United season saying we can't finish in the top four.\n",
      "So, you know, standards are on the floor.\n",
      "Of course, they are.\n",
      "Players celebrating a win.\n",
      "I'm not going to mone about it.\n",
      "It shows they care.\n",
      "Right, let's do the player ratings, because I know they're ready to go in the forum and I am back with you at eight o'clock tonight.\n",
      "We need a goalkeeper, don't we?\n",
      "Five.\n",
      "We need a goalkeeper.\n",
      "I think it's a little bit harsh on the second goal.\n",
      "It's bouncing around a lot, but does he command his area?\n",
      "Does he instill confidence?\n",
      "Of course, he doesn't below part five out of six.\n",
      "Average being six.\n",
      "Lenny, Yoro and De Ligt today.\n",
      "I'd probably give them both a 6.5.\n",
      "It's difficult.\n",
      "You're playing with a goalkeeper, you can't trust.\n",
      "You're playing with him in field that's not good enough.\n",
      "And yeah, they weren't as good as previous weeks, but I don't think either of them had a bad game.\n",
      "And I think still they're probably our two best players this season.\n",
      "So 6.5 for both of them for me.\n",
      "Shaw, probably a 6.\n",
      "Yeah, the left-hand side was our weakness, but more because of Dalot, they were getting down that side more than the right-hand side, which is interesting when you've got Diallo playing down the right-hand side.\n",
      "Bernley couldn't really exploit it, but they definitely did exploit our left-hand side.\n",
      "So I'd give Shaw a 6.\n",
      "Look, Diallo defensively, they didn't really exploit him, but going forward, I don't think he was that good up until the penalty.\n",
      "So I'd give him a 5.5.\n",
      "Yeah, I do agree.\n",
      "Look, he wins as the penalty at the end.\n",
      "He's a dangerous player.\n",
      "I really do like him, but he hasn't had the best start to the season.\n",
      "He can be a lot better.\n",
      "He was poor against Grimsby.\n",
      "He was probably slightly below average tonight.\n",
      "I'd give him a 5.5, but he did win the penalty.\n",
      "And for me, that was a penalty.\n",
      "So it's a big moment in the game.\n",
      "Casemiro, 5.5 for me.\n",
      "I mean, people said his passing was good, but look, that midfield got ran through a lot.\n",
      "A lot.\n",
      "We can't control games.\n",
      "Games are won and lost in the midfield, and the reason we can't comfortably put teams away is bad finishing, but it's also, we always let people back in because we can't control a game.\n",
      "And I think this gets missed a lot in tactical analysis.\n",
      "When we scored the first goal, Burnley came back into the game.\n",
      "When we scored the second goal, Burnley came back into the game.\n",
      "Controlling the midfield is having that 10-15 minutes when the team is going to come at you, and you lock it down, and we never can lock it down.\n",
      "It's not just about teams running through our midfield.\n",
      "It's also about, we're very bad at locking a game down.\n",
      "Couldn't do it against Spullam.\n",
      "Couldn't do it again today.\n",
      "We always let teams back in because that midfield is not able to lock a game down.\n",
      "It's erratic.\n",
      "5.3.\n",
      "Fernandes, probably my man of the match today, give him a 7.\n",
      "Long Jevete probably gave it in that because the thought makes him outplayed well.\n",
      "But, you know, he scored the penalty.\n",
      "Yeah, Fernandes was a 7 today.\n",
      "Look, I like Fernandes.\n",
      "I like him as a 10.\n",
      "I don't like him in the midfield.\n",
      "He's erratic.\n",
      "He's in discipline.\n",
      "He's our best player and worse player at times.\n",
      "But I'll give him another match today.\n",
      "It was a big moment.\n",
      "He missed last week.\n",
      "You know, it meant a lot to him.\n",
      "He's not going anywhere.\n",
      "He's going to be a very important player for us.\n",
      "He's going to be a contentious issue all season if we play him as a number eight.\n",
      "But today, against Burnley for 300 grand a week, he should be bloody man of the match, really.\n",
      "I mean, what do you expect?\n",
      "He's one of the, he's our best player.\n",
      "I'd expect him against Burnley to put a performance in.\n",
      "And, you know, he did put a performance in today.\n",
      "Was it amazing?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Was it good enough to be my amount of the match?\n",
      "The low was a five for me.\n",
      "I know he got the assist, but there was a lot of misplace passes.\n",
      "There was a lot of poor defensive work.\n",
      "There was some good crosses into the box.\n",
      "You can never doubt his personality, his hard work.\n",
      "You know, I like him as a player.\n",
      "I like his dedication to the cause.\n",
      "But he's not a left back.\n",
      "You know, he's woefully imbalanced and balanced.\n",
      "And he did get a good cut back for Mbeumo.\n",
      "He never stops running, but he is a weakness, you know?\n",
      "Mbeumo, seven, thought he had a good game.\n",
      "Could be a man of the match as well.\n",
      "Absolutely got no problem with that.\n",
      "I've given it to Fernandes.\n",
      "You could give it to Mbeumo.\n",
      "Lovely goal.\n",
      "One of the bright sparks in the team.\n",
      "Really liked this signing.\n",
      "And I think he's growing game by game.\n",
      "I think he has lacked fitness because of our lady came into the squad, but he seems to be getting better by the game.\n",
      "That's two goals and two games.\n",
      "And I think this is a really important point I made in the watch along.\n",
      "When Bern Lee equalized last season, I think we're in big trouble.\n",
      "This season we score again straight away.\n",
      "That's why we bought Mbeumo and Cunha.\n",
      "They are Premier League game changes.\n",
      "And although they did equalize again, I was very impressed with how quickly we got back into the game.\n",
      "So if you get Mbeumo, man of the match, I ain't got a problem.\n",
      "In fact, I think you might be man of the match for you lot.\n",
      "Mason Mount was a 6.5.\n",
      "I thought he played really well, but obviously he's only played half of the game.\n",
      "Disappointing, I really cannot say anything other than the stories that I'm angry at about Mason Mount is that he's going to be played by injuries for a long time.\n",
      "He's never going to be able to play two games a week and he's probably never going to have a run of games.\n",
      "It's so disappointing because he's had a good start to the season.\n",
      "The question now, is it precautionary?\n",
      "Was it managed minutes?\n",
      "Or is he actually going to be out for six weeks?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "But we can't be shocked.\n",
      "And to be honest, if he's out for a couple of months, I'll be fuming.\n",
      "But what can you do?\n",
      "We've got a player that he's injury prone.\n",
      "So I'm hoping he's not.\n",
      "But to be honest, with Mason Mount, you're always walking on thin ice waiting for it to crack.\n",
      "And I don't know what to say.\n",
      "Good player, but might be injured now.\n",
      "Same with Kanye.\n",
      "Look, Kanye is not injury prone, of course, but everything was going through him up until the injury.\n",
      "And we just hope it's not a long injury because I think he's a very, very important player for us.\n",
      "6.5 for me.\n",
      "Mazraoui, 6.\n",
      "Good to have him back.\n",
      "Mainoo, probably a six.\n",
      "Some would say a 5.5.\n",
      "I don't think, you know what?\n",
      "I don't think Mainoo did a lot wrong against Grinsby.\n",
      "And I don't think Mainoo did a lot wrong today.\n",
      "Is he the player everybody's proficerizing?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No, he's a work in progress.\n",
      "I think Amarim's absolutely correct.\n",
      "Mason, Mainoo needs to stay and fight and improve.\n",
      "Is he ready to be in the team?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "And I think Amarim again today is proven that this whole Mainoo against Amarim thing is bollocks.\n",
      "This is a player that is publicly saying, I want to leave, and he's coming on at half time.\n",
      "If Amarim didn't like Mainoo, he'd have used a Garte.\n",
      "As riskiers, that might have been.\n",
      "He brings Mainoo on instead of a Garte.\n",
      "He clearly values Mainoo.\n",
      "And Mainoo wants to go on loan.\n",
      "So I just think like, does Mainoo come on and light the world up and make you go, we don't need a midfielder?\n",
      "No, we still need a midfielder.\n",
      "So I want Mainoo to stay, but like Amarim, he's got to stay and fight and improve.\n",
      "He's not going to get straight into the team, guaranteed.\n",
      "Is he?\n",
      "He's not.\n",
      "I do want him to stay.\n",
      "I don't know why he wants to go.\n",
      "You played another 45 minutes today.\n",
      "Zirkzee, look, he ain't fit.\n",
      "5.5, he ain't fit.\n",
      "Looks good against Grimsby.\n",
      "Looked off the pace today.\n",
      "He's had no preseason.\n",
      "He looked like a player that wasn't fit.\n",
      "You know, he should have scored that goal.\n",
      "There was a few good flicks, but you know, I think you'll get better with match sharpness, certainly.\n",
      "Alfresco says, what game were you watching giving Fernandes Man of the Match and Bermé Man of the Match?\n",
      "I give him the same score, mate.\n",
      "If you want to give him Bermé Man of the Match, fine.\n",
      "Benjamin Sesko.\n",
      "5.5.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Good couple of chances on his head.\n",
      "Couldn't get them on target.\n",
      "Doesn't look back sharp.\n",
      "Needs to get sharp over the international break.\n",
      "This international break is actually good because players that aren't going on international duty get two weeks in their legs.\n",
      "Players that are going on international duty, as long as they don't get injured, come back with a couple of games under their belt.\n",
      "So I don't mind the September international break because the players that are behind catch up, but hopefully we'll start to see what Sesko's all about after the international break.\n",
      "With regards to Amarim, 50,000 watching, by the way.\n",
      "Thank you very much.\n",
      "Make sure you smash a like and subscribe.\n",
      "With regards to Amarim, I would say that, um, look, it's difficult because Amarim out is, again, a pelting.\n",
      "Amarim in is, like myself, who don't see the points in second and another manager.\n",
      "They're going to say, it's only Burnley, but you can only beat what's in front of you.\n",
      "Is it, is it Amarim's fault that we needed last minute penalty to win the game?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "It's not.\n",
      "Um, we should have been three nil up at half time.\n",

      "But in the context of the game, what does the manager actually do wrong?\n",

      "I don't know.\n",
      "It might have happened recently, but we're not very good at it.\n",
      "So for me, I'd give Amarim a six, it's Burnley, but you could give him a high asian, you give him an any lower because it's the players that made that difficult for me.\n",

      "And I do think Fernandes had a good game, by the way.\n",
      "I do think he had a good game.\n",
      "So I've only given him a seven, and I gave him Bermoa seven.\n",
      "So if you want to give, in Bermoa, I'm out of the match.\n",
      "I'm very happy for him to have it, and he's got it with eight to two percent of the vote.\n",
      "But I do think Fernandes had a good game, whether we like him or not, and I do like Fernandes.\n",
      "I just don't like him as an eight.\n",
      "It's as simple as that.\n",
