## About The Project

This project aims to harness data-driven insights and predictive modeling to forecast aspects of football player performance. Built as a Jupyter Notebook, it integrates data processing, statistical analysis, and naturala language algorithms to generate predictions that can help coaches, analysts, and fans better understand player potential.

### Key Features

- **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Support for importing datasets from CSV/JSON, preprocessing..

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Primary Notebook**: `NLP_Player.ipynb` (contains data ingestion, modeling, and visualization steps)  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Data Sources**: Mark Goldbridge Football Review Videos
